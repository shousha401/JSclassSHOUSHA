**the more practice is the better i get**
- I Like the way we are learining now and let us make something on owen at end of the class really help alot
- i love how devtools show me where is the error or what is undefine
- devtools make me understand how the code work and it save time looking for errors as well because devi tools alwywas point you to the error.
